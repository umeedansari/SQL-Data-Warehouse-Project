# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project üöÄ

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution‚Äîfrom building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in **data engineering and analytics**.

## üèóÔ∏è **Data Architecture**

The data architecture follows **Medallion Architecture**:  
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems (CSV files imported into SQL Server Database).  
2. **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes prepare the data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a **star schema** required for reporting and analytics.
